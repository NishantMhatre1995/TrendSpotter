       " {'data': \"On Friday August 19th, 1977, 30-year-old Linda Sue Ferry left her home in Mulberry, Indiana, to go grocery shopping. Linda and her husband, William “Billy” Ferry, were planning a family canoe trip the following day and she wanted to make sure they had enough supplies for the outing.   Linda left around 9:30 pm in the couple's 1965 Oldsmobile F-85 with 120 dollars in hand. She headed to a 24-hour Pay Less Grocery store located in the Tippecanoe Mall, while Billy stayed behind at home with the couple's three children, ages 13, 12, and 9. However as the night wore on and Linda failed to return home, a concerned Billy phoned police to report his wife missing.   Five days later, on August 24th, an employee at the National Homes Acceptance Company in Lafayette, Indiana pulled into the company's executive lot to find a car he did not recognize parked next to his designated parking space. As he exited his vehicle he was suddenly overcome by a putrid stench that seemed to be coming from within the vehicle. Upon closer inspection, the employee noticed swarms of flies that had gathered on and around the car's trunk. He made the decision to notify police.   Police arrived at the lot at 2:30pm to find that the mysterious car matched the description of the Ferry’s missing vehicle. Using a crowbar, they pried open the trunk. Inside, they discovered a set of severely decomposed human remains they suspected belonged to the missing wife and mother. Hours later Billy would confirm those suspicions by positively identifying Linda at the county morgue.   Linda was found partially clothed. Unfortunately due to the state her body was found in, a coroner could not determine if she had been sexually assaulted. Though an ultimate cause of death could not be determined, an autopsy showed a small bone in Linda’s throat was broken. They noted this particular type of injury is mostly found in strangulation victims. It was theorized Linda may have strangled with her own stocking, however police did not elaborate on this.   No evidence of a struggle was found inside of Linda’s green Oldsmobile. All but one rear door was found to be locked however the car keys as well as Linda’s purse were found on the seat. The 120 dollars Linda had taken for groceries was missing, but no groceries were found inside of the vehicle.   Police did learn, however, the car had been in the lot for several days. The car was first noticed on Saturday, the day after Linda’s disappearance. It remained unreported because according to company employees, the parking spot where the car was located belonged to an employee who had been on a planned vacation the week Linda went missing. As no one needed the spot, no one felt the need to report it. Even after an employee first noticed a strange smell coming from the car earlier that week, he attributed it simply to some unseen rubbish within the vehicle.   Linda and Billy had married in 1963, however divorced in 1971. For six years the couple stayed separated, however according to their family and friends, they maintained a close relationship through the years. In April 1977, the couple remarried. Together with their children, they rented a rural farmhouse in Mulberry less than six weeks prior to Linda’s death.   For sixteen years, Billy had been employed by the Lafayette Dental Laboratory. According to employees interviewed by police, Linda would frequently visit Billy at the office. They described her as a kind hearted woman who was “the kind of person who would give you her last dime if you needed it.” When asked about the Ferry’s relationship, they said the pair were very much in love, even adding that Billy would oftentimes make small handmade gifts for Linda from items at the office. They also described her as “tough” and a dedicated mom. One employee said “I can’t see anyone jumping her without her fighting, unless they maybe had a gun. She would do anything to stay alive for her kids”  Though they appeared to be happy, the Ferry’s had faced more than their fair share of troubles over the last few months. Just prior to Linda and Billy’s second wedding, their 9 year old daughter, Sharon, was hit by a car and spent seven weeks in the hospital. During this time Linda was recovering from a hysterectomy, and had been laid off from her factory job, leaving her without health insurance.   After Linda went missing, Sharon’s grandma took her to have an additional surgery on her hand. While en route to the appointment, Billy wrecked his motorcycle, totaling the bike, but leaving him unscathed.  Billy was thoroughly questioned by police, however they do not believe he had anything to do with Linda’s murder. Investigators questioned one other local man when a tip was reported he was seen with Linda on the night of her murder at a motel. His name was not released however, he was dismissed as a suspect when police confirmed he was in Florida that evening.   Though police were without suspects, they were not without theories, including a possible serial killer theory. Some investigators closely compared Linda’s murder, to the murder of 19-year-old Kristine Kozik. Kristine, a Purdue University student, had vanished in May 1977 after borrowing a friend's car. Her body was discovered in a field just outside of Lafayette, however, like Linda, her ultimate cause of death could not be determined. Despite the similarities, the cases have never been proven to be related.   In 1982, serial killer Carl Eugene Watts was offered immunity in exchange for a confession about Linda and Kristine’s murders. He denied having any knowledge of either crime however. Furthermore, fingerprint evidence collected by investigators failed to match Carl to the crime. After failing to connect Carl to Linda’s murder, her case quickly went cold and sadly has remained that way ever since.   Linda was laid to rest in Mulberry’s Fairhaven Cemetery. In 2018, Billy passed away at the age of 74. He too was buried in Fairhaven.

Five days later, Linda’s badly decomposed remains were discovered in the trunk of her Oldsmobile in nearby Lafayette, Indiana.\",\n",
